How ready you are to start new step in your career's Path. i would say like 70% because i now understand like most of the concept of programing and how they work.eg javascript,react,node,expressand mongodb

Any thought that you want to talk about especially the skills you gain during the Bootcamp.not really, but i would say i was guard and directed to the right tools and frame
My immediate goal is to:

- [E.g., land a position as a junior developer].
- [E.g., contribute to open-source projects to refine my skills].
- [E.g., learn advanced concepts in cloud computing or AI].

Thank you for your guidance and support throughout this journey!
